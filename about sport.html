    <h1>Sport</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Defination</h2>
<p>Sports are group games and individual activities involving physical activity and skills.</p>
<h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain, or 
        improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases,
         entertainment to spectators. Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
         Sports help children develop physical skills, get exercise , make friends, have fun, learn to play as a member of a team, learn to play fair, and improve self-esteem .
         Participation in sports is a great way of staying active and offers wonderful rewards for mental health. Being involved in sports has been proven to help children learn valuable skills for dealing with life's ups and downs. They teach youth how to interact with others and work as a team. This skill facilitates working with others in other ways such as on a class project or a school play. Sports also help students become more independent and feel better about themselves. The result is positive self-esteem and self-confidence, which are extremely important for determining later happiness and success.

 <h2>The few types of sport-</h2>

         using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing teamâ€™s goal.
         Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. 
         The team that scores more goals wins.

    <h3>Cricket-</h3>
    <P>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 
        22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
        The batting side scores runs  by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and then running between the wickets,
         while the bowling and fielding side tries to  prevent this (by preventing  the ball from leaving the field, and getting the 
         ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either 
        catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
         batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.</P>

        <h3>Hockey-</h3>
        <p>Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor
          field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.
          There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. 
          In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. 
          "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey".</p>
