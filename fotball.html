    <div>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
       Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
       Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania);
       gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;
       rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extent common 
       origins and are known as football codes.

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Though “folk football” had been played since medieval times
       with varying rules, the game began to be standardized when it was taken up as a winter game at public schools.
       The Football Association, formed in 1863, codified the rules of the game and hosted the first cup competition between
       regional football clubs in Britain.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been
        played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, 
        which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal 
        prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the 
        early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) 
        schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball
        and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing
        except with former schoolmates. </p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>By the early 20th century, football had spread across Europe, but it was in need of international organization. 
       A solution was found in 1904, when representatives from the football associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, 
       the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland founded the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).

        of duly receiving the wages agreed with their clubs.FIFA has set aside USD 16 million for the fund up to 2022,
         with this allocation to be divided as follows: USD 3m in 2020, USD 4m in 2021 and USD 4m in 2022, plus a further
