    <h1>Cricket</h1>

    <div>
    <b>Cricket</b> is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs, while the other team is fielding, 
    and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team,
     across the boundary, or by the two batting players running back-and-forth between the two wickets.

    <h3><u>History</u></h3>
    <p> There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of 
        dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England.Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys 
        bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was 
        called a bail and the entire gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this preferable to the stump, which name was 
        later applied to the hurdle uprights.Early manuscripts differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the pitch—the 
        area between the wickets—was 22  yards long.The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th century. Its modern weight of between 5.5 
        and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774.
